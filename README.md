# Kaggle Data Analysis and Machine Learning Models

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks of various data analysis and machine learning models I've built for Kaggle datasets. Each notebook is a comprehensive walkthrough of the data analysis process, from data cleaning and exploration to building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Repository Structure

Each dataset has its own directory, named after the dataset. Inside each directory, you'll find a Jupyter notebook that contains the code and a detailed explanation of the steps taken.

## Datasets

Here are some of the datasets included in this repository:

- Breast Cancer data EDA and NN Model
- Biopsy Cancer Classification (Voting Classifier)
- Decoding Resume Attributes for Job Callbacks
- Failed Banks Data Analysis
- US Company Bankruptcy Prediction: 93% Accuracy
- Heart Disease Prediction: RF Model - 85% Acc
- US Home Prices: Supply-Demand Dynamics
- ICR - EDA and XGBClassifier
- ...

## Installation

To run these notebooks, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```
